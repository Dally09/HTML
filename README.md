# HTML

# NB
I kept coming across this error message: 
    fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): . git. 

The cause of this error message is running a Git command outside of a directory in which a Git folder is initialized.
So I run "ls" to see which folders were available. Then I moved to HTML. It actually worked!

I scored a 72% i.e. 29/40 in my first HTML Quiz.
